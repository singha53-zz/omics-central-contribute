# Rationale {-}

This purpose of this book is to 1) provide a guide to self-host Omics Central on one's own Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and 2) extending omics central by contributing additional functionality (methods, visualizations). 

If users would like to add additional features or make changes to the existing application they are welcome to submit pull requests to (omics-central-front-end, omics-central-backend and omics-central-docker) as well as to the documentation (omics-central-learn) and implementation (omics-central-contribute).
